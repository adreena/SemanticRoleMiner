Plugins
=======

The package defines a plugin interface for parsers, stores, and serializers that other packages can use to implement parsers, stores, and serializers that will plug into the ``rdflib`` package.

The diagram below describes the current set of plugins that are either built in to rdflib or are available in the `rdfextras <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/rdfextras/>`_ support package:

.. glossary::

    graph
        An RDF graph is a set of RDF triples. The set of nodes of an RDF graph
        is the set of subjects and objects of triples in the graph.
    
    named graph
        Named Graphs is the idea that having multiple RDF graphs in a single
        document/repository and naming them with URIs provides useful
        additional functionality. -- http://www.w3.org/2004/03/trix/
