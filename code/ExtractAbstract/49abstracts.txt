Abstract: The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), in cooperation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has launched an Emerging Infections Network (EIN). This network of infectious diseases consultants was conceived as a sentinel system to monitor new or resurgent infectious diseases in a way that would complement other public health surveillance efforts. A pilot study with 169 participants recruited from 32 of the IDSA's state and regional societies confirmed the feasibility and potential value of this network. More than 300 infectious diseases consultants are currently participating in the IDSA EIN. Future plans include aggressive probing for clinical experiences that indicate or suggest the presence of emerging infections, initiation of prospective studies for selected infectious diseases, and other activities designed both to benefit consultants in infectious diseases and to make use of their services.

Abstract: Transboundary animal diseases (TADs) constitute a global threat that afflict livestock. They are characterized by the suddenness, acuteness, the rapidity with which they can spread in susceptible livestock populations and the widespread nature of the losses that they can produce. The havoc they play renders individual farmers and private veterinary services relatively powerless to take effective action. As TADs do not recognize national borders, there is a great demand for regional cooperation which must be put into a global term. From the epidemiological point of view, the prospects for eradication of a disease with minimal production losses and other costs are best, if the disease can be recognized early where it is localized and then a disease control programme be quickly implemented.

Abstract: The European Community (EC) has been collecting for 15 years data on zoonoses and agents thereof that integrate the information from human cases and their occurrence in food and animals. The current data collection covers 11 zoonotic agents: Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria, verotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC), Yersinia spp., Brucella, Mycobacterium bovis, Trichinella and Echinoccoccus, as well as rabies and food-borne outbreaks. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is assigned the tasks of examining the data collected and publishing the Community Summary Report. This Report is prepared in close collaboration with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) responsible for the surveillance of the communicable diseases in humans, and with EFSA's Zoonoses Collaboration Centre (ZCC, in the Technical University of Denmark). Member States report the data on animals, feed, food and food-borne outbreaks to EFSA's web-based reporting system and the data on the human cases are reported to ECDC's web-application for The European Surveillance System (TESSy). The flow and analysis of data are described as well as an outline of the future plans to improve the comparability of the data.

Abstract: The veterinary public health (VPH) program at the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) began in 1949 when an arrangement with the newly founded World Health Organization made PAHO its Regional Office for the Americas to serve as the specialized health agency both for the Organization of American States and the United Nations. It started as a Section of Veterinary Medicine to help eradicate rabies on both sides of the US-Mexico border, and PAHO grew to be the biggest VPH program in the world. By providing a political and technical base, PAHO assisted its member states to organize and develop their national VPH programs and activities, and it provides technical cooperation and works with their national counterparts to solve national and local problems. In the 1980s and 1990s, PAHO concentrated that cooperation on several, specific needs: the elimination of dog-transmitted human rabies, hemispheric eradication of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), regional action planning for food safety, control/eradication of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis, and surveillance and prevention of emerging zoonoses and food-borne diseases. The Pan American centers developed a number of diagnostic antigens and a continental system for the surveillance of FMD and vesicular diseases, using geographic quadrant technology to augment sensitivity, analyze data, and make decisions. Another visible accomplishment is the elimination of hydatidosis in the endemic countries and regions of the southern cone. In addition, the VPH program of PAHO pioneered the mobilization of the private sector to participate in official programs. Nevertheless, privatization of animal and human health services has had a negative effect on human resources and infrastructure by weakening essential epidemiological functions in some countries. Today, there is a need for closer coordination between veterinary medicine and medical services. Practically all potential bioterrorism agents are zoonoses, and it is cost-effective to control them at the veterinary level, providing the first line of defense. The opportunities for VPH are boundless, but the challenge is to be able to apply the plethora of available research results and knowledge. What we will need is a new breed of veterinarians who will lead and provide us with a vision, like those we honored in 2005 at the Schwabe Symposium Honoring the Lifetime Achievements of Dr. James H. Steele: veterinarians in public health who will be in the forefront of policy setting, decision-making, and allocation of resources, and veterinarians who will articulate and provide a strategic direction to our unique professional skills.

Abstract: Three outbreaks of disease in the USA in 1993 caused by Escherichia coli O157:H7, Cryptosporidium organisms, and a previously unrecognized hantavirus clearly illustrate the increasing challenges posed by emerging infectious diseases. The largest USA outbreak of Esch. coli O157:H7 infection reported occurred as a result of contaminated hamburgers served at a fast-food restaurant chain. The largest recorded waterborne disease outbreak in USA history was due to contamination of a municipal water supply with cryptosporidia. In the southwestern USA, hantavirus was first recognized as the cause of a pulmonary syndrome with a mortality rate exceeding 50%. The detection of and response to these outbreaks document the need for a strong partnership between the clinical and public health sectors to prevent and control diseases. Health care reform in the USA provides an opportunity to address critical needs, such as improved surveillance and diagnosis, to ensure timely detection of and rapid response to newly emerging infectious diseases.

Abstract: Surveillance and control of emerging bacterial zoonoses is essential in order to prevent both human and animal deaths and to avoid potential economic disorders created by trade barriers or a ban on free circulation of human or animal populations. An increased risk of exposition to zoonotic agents, the breakdown of the host's defenses, the emergence of bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics and their widespread distribution as well as conjunctural causes associated with the action or inaction of man have been identified as the main factors leading to the emergence or re-emergence of bacterial zoonoses. After an in-depth review of these various factors, the present manuscript reviews the main components of detection and surveillance of emerging or re-emerging bacterial zoonoses. A description of the systems of control and the main obstacles to their success is also presented. Detection and surveillance of emerging zoonoses have greatly benefited from technical progress in diagnostics. The success of detection and control of emerging bacterial zoonoses is largely based on international solidarity and cooperation between countries. [References: 64]

Short Title: The challenges posed by reemerging Clostridium difficile infection

ISSN: 1058-4838

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/518874

Abstract: There have been recent, marked increases in the incidence and severity of Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD). These may be attributable to the emergence of a hypervirulent strain of C. difficile that produces increased levels of toxins A and B, as well as an extra toxin known as "binary toxin." This previously uncommon strain has become epidemic, coincident with its development of increased resistance to fluoroquinolones, the use of which is increasingly associated with CDAD outbreaks. Although not necessarily related to this epidemic strain, unusually severe CDAD has been reported in populations that had previously been thought to be at low risk, including peripartum women and healthy persons living in the community. Challenges posed by the changing epidemiology of CDAD are compounded by current limitations in diagnostic testing, treatment, and infection control. Overcoming these challenges and limitations will require a concerted effort from a variety of sources, including an ongoing partnership between infectious disease clinicians and public health professionals.

Abstract: The Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center's Division of Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (AFHSC-GEIS) supports and oversees surveillance for emerging infectious diseases, including respiratory diseases, of importance to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). AFHSC-GEIS accomplishes this mission by providing funding and oversight to a global network of partners for respiratory disease surveillance. This report details the system's surveillance activities during 2009, with a focus on efforts in responding to the novel H1N1 Influenza A (A/H1N1) pandemic and contributions to global public health. Active surveillance networks established by AFHSC-GEIS partners resulted in the initial detection of novel A/H1N1 influenza in the U.S. and several other countries, and viruses isolated from these activities were used as seed strains for the 2009 pandemic influenza vaccine. Partners also provided diagnostic laboratory training and capacity building to host nations to assist with the novel A/H1N1 pandemic global response, adapted a Food and Drug Administration-approved assay for use on a ruggedized polymerase chain reaction platform for diagnosing novel A/H1N1 in remote settings, and provided estimates of seasonal vaccine effectiveness against novel A/H1N1 illness. Regular reporting of the system's worldwide surveillance findings to the global public health community enabled leaders to make informed decisions on disease mitigation measures and controls for the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic. AFHSC-GEIS's support of a global network contributes to DoD's force health protection, while supporting global public health.

Abstract: The characteristics of patients with suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) hospitalized in a hospital in Paris, France were studied to analyse the hypothetical differences between epidemiological and clinical management of an emerging disease epidemic and to gather experience for the management of the next outbreak. All 90 patients hospitalized between 16 March and 30 April 2003 were included. Epidemiological and clinical data were shared with the French National Institute for Health. Cases were classified according to both the official definition ('possible', 'probable' and 'excluded') and the local one, adapted from the official definition but including an additional level of suspicion ('equivocal'), intermediate between 'possible' and 'excluded'. The initial assessment was different in 39% of the cases (n=35), according to epidemiological (n=24) or clinical (n=11) elements. The final assessment diverged in 54% of the cases (n=47). All patients were officially considered as 'excluded' for epidemiologists, while 47 remained as 'possible' or 'equivocal' cases of SARS according to clinicians. It is concluded that risk assessment was different in almost 40% of the cases, with no impact on epidemic diffusion or hospital-borne exposure as no probable case of SARS was diagnosed among these patients or their households. The confrontation of these different points of view will thus enrich the interdisciplinary management of eventual future outbreaks.

Abstract: Conservation medicine, the medical practice that seeks to promote ecological health and well being of a defined habitat, functions at the intersection of animal, human and ecosystem health. It differs from classical public-health epidemiology and medicine in that it aims to protect and improve animal health and related ecosystems, in addition to human health. Zoonotic diseases and emerging diseases are of primary concern and are particularly important when Endangered great-ape populations are involved. The effective practice of conservation medicine demands an integrated cross-disciplinary team approach involving wildlife and livestock veterinarians, local physicians, public-health professionals, ecologists, government officials and communities. Common interests, improved data collection and economies of scale argue for combining health surveillance, data and delivery efforts. This team approach needs to be tailored to the infrastructure and sophistication of the host country's human and livestock/wildlife health systems. It is often, by default, the wildlife veterinarian(s) who coordinate(s) the integrated 'one health' approach because of their training in wildlife and livestock medicine as well as in zoonotic and emerging disease issues. This paper describes the Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project's (MGVP Inc.) collaborative cross-disciplinary strategy for Mountain gorilla Gorilla beringei beringei conservation and the database system developed during the process.

Abstract: June 2011 marks the 30th anniversary of the first description of what became known as HIV/AIDS, now one of history's worst pandemics. The basic public health tools of surveillance and epidemiologic investigation helped define the epidemic and led to initial prevention recommendations. Features of the epidemic, including the zoonotic origin of HIV and its spread through global travel, are central to the concept of emerging infectious diseases. As the epidemic expanded into developing countries, new models of global health and new global partnerships developed. Advocacy groups played a major role in mobilizing the response to the epidemic, having human rights as a central theme. Through the commitments of governments and private donors, modern HIV treatment has become available throughout the developing world. Although the end of the epidemic is not yet in sight and many challenges remain, the response has been remarkable and global health has changed for the better.

Abstract: Influenza highlights the relevance of One Health, where experts in animal, human and environmental health combine to solve inter-related problems. Human disease due to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza and avian and human disease due to influenza A/H5N1 are recent examples of new zoonoses with significant global impact. Management and prevention of influenza and other emerging infectious diseases requires the expansion and continuing support of collaborations between human and animal health experts at the clinical, diagnostic laboratory, public health, research and training levels.

Abstract: Reference laboratories are of central importance for consumer protection. Field expertise and high scientific competence are basic requirements for the nomination of a national reference laboratory. To ensure a common approach in the analysis of zoonotic hazards, standards have been developed by the reference laboratories together with national official laboratories on the basis of Art. 33 of Directive (EG) No. 882/2004. Reference laboratories function as arbitrative boards in the case of ambivalent or debatable results. New methods for detection of zoonotic agents are developed and validated to provide tools for analysis, e. g., in legal cases, if results from different parties are disputed. Besides these tasks, national reference laboratories offer capacity building and advanced training courses and control the performance of ring trials to ensure consistency in the quality of analyses in official laboratories. All reference laboratories work according to the ISO standard 17025 which defines the grounds for strict laboratory quality rules and in cooperation with the respective Community Reference Laboratories (CRL). From the group of veterinary reference laboratories for food-borne zoonoses, the national reference laboratories are responsible for Listeria monocytogenes, for Campylobacter, for the surveillance and control of viral and bacterial contamination of bivalve molluscs, for E. coli, for the performance of analysis and tests on zoonoses (Salmonella), and from the group of parasitological zoonotic agents, the national reference laboratory for Trichinella.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To document and verify the number of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2002-2003 epidemic in mainland China. METHOD: All existing Chinese SARS data sources were integrated in one final database. This involved removing non-probable and duplicate cases, adding cases at the final stage of the outbreak, and collecting missing information. RESULTS: The resulting database contains a total of 5327 probable SARS cases, of whom 343 died, giving a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 6.4%. While the total number of cases happens to be equal to the original official reports, there are 5 cases overall which did not result in death. When compared with Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, China Taiwan, and Singapore, the SARS epidemic in mainland China resulted in a considerably lower CFR, involved relatively younger cases and included fewer health care workers. CONCLUSIONS: To optimise future data collection during large-scale outbreaks of emerging or re-emerging infectious disease, China must further improve the infectious diseases reporting system, enhance collaboration between all levels of disease control, health departments, hospitals and institutes nationally and globally, and train specialized staff working at county centres of disease control.

Title: GeoSentinel: the global emerging infections sentinel network of the International Society of Travel Medicine

Short Title: GeoSentinel: the global emerging infections sentinel network of the International Society of Travel Medicine

Abstract: GeoSentinel is a network of 22 member travel/tropical medicine clinics (14 in the USA and 8 in other countries) initiated in 1995 by the International Society of Travel Medicine (ISTM). GeoSentinel is based on the concept that these clinics are ideally situated to effectively detect geographic and temporal trends in morbidity among travellers. The core surveillance tool is a single-page faxable form submitted to a central data site for each post-travel patient, including immigrants, refugees, and foreign visitors. Diagnoses are entered either as specific aetiologies or as syndromes and are then linked to geographic locations, reference dates, and clinical presentations. In addition, electronic communication with the larger body of worldwide ISTM member clinics is periodically done to obtain broader data collection in response to specific inquires. The scope of GeoSentinel has broadened from the initial vision of a provider-based sentinel network tracking emerging infections at their point of entry into developed countries. Its present goals are: to monitor global trends in disease occurrence among travellers; to ascertain risk factors and morbidity in groups of travellers categorized by travel purpose and type of traveller; to respond to urgent public health queries; to develop educational priorities for travellers' health; and to effect a rapid response by electronically disseminating alerts to surveillance sites, to all ISTM members in 55 countries, and to public health authorities. In addition, a major byproduct of the network, and now one of its strongest assets, has been the growth of partnerships between ISTM, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and health-care providers around the world, as well as other medical societies, government, and private organizations. The demographic data, travel patterns, and clinical presentations for the first 2813 patient records analysed from the GeoSentinel sites are summarized in this paper.

Abstract: The threat of bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases has prompted various public health agencies to recommend enhanced surveillance activities to supplement existing surveillance plans. The majority of emerging infectious diseases and bioterrorist agents are zoonotic. Animals are more sensitive to certain biological agents, and their use as clinical sentinels, as a means of early detection, is warranted. This article provides design methods for a local integrated zoonotic surveillance plan and materials developed for veterinarians to assist in the early detection of bioevents. Zoonotic surveillance in the U.S. is currently too limited and compartmentalized for broader public health objectives. To rapidly detect and respond to bioevents, collaboration and cooperation among various agencies at the federal, state, and local levels must be enhanced and maintained. Co-analysis of animal and human diseases may facilitate the response to infectious disease events and limit morbidity and mortality in both animal and human populations.

Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been described as the first major emerging infectious disease of the twenty-first century. Having initially emerged, almost unnoticed, in southern China, it rapidly spread across the globe. It severely tested national public health and health systems. However, it also resulted in rapid, intensive international collaboration, led by the World Health Organization, to elucidate its characteristics and cause and to contain its spread. The UK mounted a vigorous public health response. Some particular issues concerned: the practicalities of implementing exit screening had this been required; the likely efficacy of this and other control measures; the legal base for public health action; and the surge capacity in all systems should the disease have taken hold in the UK. We have used this experience of 2003 to inform our preparation of a framework for an integrated, escalating response to a future re-emergence of SARS according to the levels of disease activity worldwide. Recent cases confirm that SARS has not "gone away". We cannot be complacent about our contingency planning.

Short Title: The international response to the outbreak of SARS in 2003

ISSN: 0962-8436

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2004.1484

Abstract: The sudden arrival of an internationally spreading outbreak of a newly identified infectious disease in early 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), provided an opportunity for a coordinated international response based on information and evidence obtained in real time through standard and electronic communications. Its containment represents a new way of working internationally, and demonstrates how intense collaboration in virology, clinical medicine and epidemiology can rapidly provide the information necessary to create and implement evidence-based control measures. The SARS outbreak serves as a reminder of the need for a strong national surveillance and response to infectious diseases, evidence-based international travel recommendations, and a global alert and response network to serve as a safety net when national surveillance fails.

Abstract: The North is a frontier for exploration of emerging infectious diseases and the large-scale drivers influencing distribution, host associations, and evolution of pathogens among persons, domestic animals, and wildlife. Leading into the International Polar Year 2007-2008, we outline approaches, protocols, and empirical models derived from a decade of integrated research on northern host-parasite systems. Investigations of emerging infectious diseases associated with parasites in northern wildlife involved a network of multidisciplinary collaborators and incorporated geographic surveys, archival collections, historical foundations for diversity, and laboratory and field studies exploring the interface for hosts, parasites, and the environment. In this system, emergence of parasitic disease was linked to geographic expansion, host switching, resurgence due to climate change, and newly recognized parasite species. Such integrative approaches serve as cornerstones for detection, prediction, and potential mitigation of emerging infectious diseases in wildlife and persons in the North and elsewhere under a changing global climate.

Abstract: A cornerstone of effective disease surveillance programs comprises the early identification of infectious threats and the subsequent rapid response to prevent further spread. Effectively identifying, tracking and responding to these threats is often difficult and requires international cooperation due to the rapidity with which diseases cross national borders and spread throughout the global community as a result of travel and migration by humans and animals. From Oct.1, 2008 to Sept. 30, 2009, the United States Department of Defense's (DoD) Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (AFHSC-GEIS) identified 76 outbreaks in 53 countries. Emerging infectious disease outbreaks were identified by the global network and included a wide spectrum of support activities in collaboration with host country partners, several of which were in direct support of the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005). The network also supported military forces around the world affected by the novel influenza A/H1N1 pandemic of 2009. With IHR (2005) as the guiding framework for action, the AFHSC-GEIS network of international partners and overseas research laboratories continues to develop into a far-reaching system for identifying, analyzing and responding to emerging disease threats.

Short Title: Wildlife as source of zoonotic infections. (Zoonotic diseases)

ISSN: 1080-6040

Abstract: Zoonoses with a wildlife reservoir represent a major public health problem, affecting all continents. Hundreds of pathogens and many different transmission modes are involved, and many factors influence the epidemiology of the various zoonoses. The importance and recognition of wildlife as a reservoir of zoonoses are increasing. Cost-effective prevention and control of these zoonoses necessitate an interdisciplinary and holistic approach and international cooperation. Surveillance, laboratory capability, research, training and education, and communication are key elements.

Abstract: This paper summarizes some of the lessons learned since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in November 2002 in Guangdong, China, particularly on the features of SARS (and its agent, SARS coronavirus) that distinguished it from other viral respiratory diseases, and its mode of transmission. The likelihood that it will return and the geographical location of new outbreaks will depend on the reservoir for SARS coronavirus, which may include humans, laboratories and animals. The ongoing surveillance, research and cooperation both within China and other countries will be critical for understanding the risk, recognizing the reintroduction of SARS if it occurs, and controlling human-to-human transmission. The distribution of cases during a SARS outbreak in Ontario, Canada between 23 February and 12 June 2003 is reported.

Abstract: Zoos are ideally placed to act as epidemiological monitoring stations because for decades, many have been building up detailed collections of serum banks, tissue banks and medical record-keeping systems that could be mined for information that would be beneficial to public health. For example, in 1999 wild Crows Corvus brachyrhynchos in the United States of America started to die of unknown causes but it was not until some died in the grounds of a zoological institution that West Nile virus, which is a threat to both human and animal health, was identified. There is a serious disparity in the type and amount of biosurveillance provided for humans, agricultural livestock and wildlife agencies, often driven by economic factors. There is an argument for public-health entities to contribute funds to the cost of managing serum-banks and testing stations within zoos to enhance biosurveillance in urban settings, in a cost-effective and mutually beneficial manner. The key to sustainable and integrated biosurveillance lies in public-health professionals working with zoo professionals, who care for wild animals on a day-to-day basis, to create electronic surveillance networks. This could be of utmost benefit to everyone.

Abstract: The occurrence of major zoonotic disease outbreaks in Sub-Saharan Africa has had a significant impact on the already constrained public health systems. This has, as a result, justified the need to identify creative strategies to address threats from emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases at the human-animal-environmental interface, and implement robust multi-disease public health surveillance systems that will enhance early detection and response. Additionally, enhanced reporting and timely investigation of all suspected notifiable infectious disease threats within the health system is vital. Field epidemiology and laboratory training programs (FELTPs) have made significant contributions to public health systems for more than 10 years by producing highly skilled field epidemiologists. These epidemiologists have not only improved disease surveillance and response to outbreaks, but also improved management of health systems. Furthermore, the FETPs/FELTPs have laid an excellent foundation that brings clinicians, veterinarians, and environmental health professionals drawn from different governmental sectors, to work with a common purpose of disease control and prevention. The emergence of the One Health approach in the last decade has coincided with the present, paradigm, shift that calls for multi-sectoral and cross-sectoral collaboration towards disease surveillance, detection, reporting and timely response. The positive impact from the integration of FETP/FELTP and the One Health approach by selected programs in Africa has demonstrated the importance of multi-sectoral collaboration in addressing threats from infectious and non- infectious causes to man, animals and the environment.

Short Title: Severe acute respiratory syndrome: developing a research response

ISSN: 0022-1899

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/382225

Abstract: When severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first came to world attention in March 2003, it was immediately perceived to be a global threat with a pandemic potential. To help coordinate international research efforts, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases convened a colloquium entitled SARS: Developing a Research Response on 30 May 2003. Breakout sessions intended to identify unmet research needs in 5 areas of SARS research - clinical research, epidemiology, diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines - are summarized here. Since this meeting, however, the identified research needs have been only partially met. Needs that have yet to be realized include reliable methods for early identification of individuals with SARS, a full description of SARS pathogenesis and immune response, and animal models that faithfully mimic SARS respiratory symptoms. It is also of the utmost importance that the global scientific community enhance mechanisms for international cooperation and planning for SARS research, as well as for other emerging infectious disease threats that are certain to arise in the future.

Abstract: Failure to establish a contingency plan prior to a public health emergency can have catastrophic consequences. The threat of a new influenza pandemic has prompted countries to draft national strategic preparedness plans to prevent, mitigate, and recover from a potential influenza pandemic. This paper examines these preparations in Latin America and the Caribbean and describes potential scenarios of pandemic impact on the burden of mortality and on health services in the Region. In particular, the paper reports on the progress made by Member States in developing national influenza pandemic preparedness plans and implementation mechanisms at both the national and local levels. These achievements were facilitated through a series of planning workshops and self- assessment exercises conducted by PAHO for intersectoral country teams and guided by the WHO global influenza preparedness plan. Although significant progress has been made in plan completeness, intercountry preparedness planning and local level implementation remain key challenges. Multisectoral partnerships are clearly paramount to securing the commitment and resources needed to reach and sustain effective pandemic preparedness in the Americas.

Abstract: The burden of diseases caused by food-borne pathogens remains largely unknown. Importantly data indicating trends in food-borne infectious intestinal disease is limited to a few industrialised countries, and even fewer pathogens. It has been predicted that the importance of diarrhoeal disease, mainly due to contaminated food and water, as a cause of death will decline worldwide. Evidence for such a downward trend is limited. This prediction presumes that improvements in the production and retail of microbiologically safe food will be sustained in the developed world and, moreover, will be rolled out to those countries of the developing world increasingly producing food for a global market. In this review evidence is presented to indicate that the microbiological safety of food remains a dynamic situation heavily influenced by multiple factors along the food chain from farm to fork. Sustaining food safety standards will depend on constant vigilance maintained by monitoring and surveillance but, with the rising importance of other food-related issues, such as food security, obesity and climate change, competition for resources in the future to enable this may be fierce. In addition the pathogen populations relevant to food safety are not static. Food is an excellent vehicle by which many pathogens (bacteria, viruses/prions and parasites) can reach an appropriate colonisation site in a new host. Although food production practices change, the well-recognised food-borne pathogens, such as Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli, seem able to evolve to exploit novel opportunities, for example fresh produce, and even generate new public health challenges, for example antimicrobial resistance. In addition, previously unknown food-borne pathogens, many of which are zoonotic, are constantly emerging. Current understanding of the trends in food-borne diseases for bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens has been reviewed. The bacterial pathogens are exemplified by those well-recognized by policy makers; i.e. Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Antimicrobial resistance in several bacterial food-borne pathogens (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella and Vibrio spp., methicillin resistant Staphylcoccus aureas, E. coli and Enterococci) has been discussed as a separate topic because of its relative importance to policy issues. Awareness and surveillance of viral food-borne pathogens is generally poor but emphasis is placed on Norovirus, Hepatitis A, rotaviruses and newly emerging viruses such as SARS. Many food-borne parasitic pathogens are known (for example Ascaris, Cryptosporidia and Trichinella) but few of these are effectively monitored in foods, livestock and wildlife and their epidemiology through the food-chain is poorly understood. The lessons learned and future challenges in each topic are debated. It is clear that one overall challenge is the generation and maintenance of constructive dialogue and collaboration between public health, veterinary and food safety experts, bringing together multidisciplinary skills and multi-pathogen expertise. Such collaboration is essential to monitor changing trends in the well-recognised diseases and detect emerging pathogens. It will also be necessary understand the multiple interactions these pathogens have with their environments during transmission along the food chain in order to develop effective prevention and control strategies.

Abstract: Training is a key component of building capacity for public health surveillance and response, but has often been difficult to quantify. During fiscal 2009, the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center, Division of Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (AFHSC-GEIS) supported 18 partner organizations in conducting 123 training initiatives in 40 countries for 3,130 U.S. military, civilian and host-country personnel. The training assisted with supporting compliance with International Health Regulations, IHR (2005). Training activities in pandemic preparedness, outbreak investigation and response, emerging infectious disease (EID) surveillance and pathogen diagnostic techniques were expanded significantly. By engaging local health and other government officials and civilian institutions, the U.S. military's role as a key stakeholder in global public health has been strengthened and has contributed to EID-related surveillance, research and capacity-building initiatives specified elsewhere in this issue. Public health and emerging infections surveillance training accomplished by AFHSC-GEIS and its Department of Defense (DoD) partners during fiscal 2009 will be tabulated and described.

*Zoonoses/ep [Epidemiology]

Abstract: The world is rapidly changing in many aspects concerning veterinary medicine, and man-animal relationships in urban areas represents a real challenge for the profession. Unlike the vertical approach of the academic teaching tradition, veterinary urban hygiene needs a strong holistic-epidemiologic support. Year by year, new animals, new animal uses, new fashions, new zoonoses, and new problems appeared amplified by media with the duty of the public veterinary services to solve them. The practical experience of many years of these continuous challenges is now concentrated on a new health sector: urban veterinary hygiene that now calls for a multidisciplinary and intersectoral collaboration with other professional categories to guarantee human, animal and environment health.

Abstract: Infectious disease ecology has recently raised its public profile beyond the scientific community due to the major threats that wildlife infections pose to biological conservation, animal welfare, human health and food security. As we start unravelling the full extent of emerging infectious diseases, there is an urgent need to facilitate multidisciplinary research in this area. Even though research in ecology has always had a strong theoretical component, cultural and technical hurdles often hamper direct collaboration between theoreticians and empiricists. Building upon our collective experience of multidisciplinary research and teaching in this area, we propose practical guidelines to help with effective integration among mathematical modelling, fieldwork and laboratory work. Modelling tools can be used at all steps of a field-based research programme, from the formulation of working hypotheses to field study design and data analysis. We illustrate our model-guided fieldwork framework with two case studies we have been conducting on wildlife infectious diseases: plague transmission in prairie dogs and lyssavirus dynamics in American and African bats. These demonstrate that mechanistic models, if properly integrated in research programmes, can provide a framework for holistic approaches to complex biological systems.

Abstract: Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) was introduced into the Americas in 1870. At that time the disease was described simultaneously in the North coast of the United States of North America, the Province of Buenos Aires in Argentina, the central region of Chile, Uruguay, and South Brazil. At the beginning of the twentieth century the disease spread to the rest of Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Peru. In 1950 the disease was introduced into Venezuela, and in the same year to Colombia, and from there to Ecuador. The United States of America eradicated an outbreak of FMD in 1929. Outbreaks of FMD were also eradicated from Mexico in 1947 and from Canada in 1952. The last outbreak that occurred in Mexico in 1954 was also eradicated. In 1951 the Americas Animal Health Authorities decided to establish a Pan-American Foot-and-Mouth Disease Center (PANAFTOSA), initially as a special program within the American States Organization (OAS). The center was later transferred to the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO). In the early 1970s PANAFTOSA developed a proposal for a continental surveillance system for vesicular diseases, which was approved by Agriculture Ministers at an International Meeting for FMD and Zoonoses (RICAZ). Since then, PANAFTOSA dedicated all efforts to collaborate with each country in the implementation of the system and to receive, analyze, and distribute a weekly report of vesicular diseases. The model was elaborated using coordinate grid maps, one for the South American Continent, others for each country in the region. The reports from each country consist of the grid location for any suspicious outbreak of vesicular disease. Using the information gathered during visits to the countries, as well as weekly reports, and by studying the most frequent animal movements within the region, PANAFTOSA developed a proposal for FMD eradication. This plan was approved by the Government of South America and implemented in cooperation with PANAFTOSA. The hemispheric plan for FMD eradication (PHEFA), has been implemented and today Chile and Uruguay are FMD free without vaccination; Argentina, Paraguay, and the states of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina in Brazil are also recognized by the OIE to be FMD Free, with vaccination. The use of the continental surveillance system is the main strategy for achieving the eradication of FMD in South America. At this time PANAFTOSA is working to improve the system, and to add other diseases indicated by the governments of the Americas.

ISSN: 0196-4399

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinmicnews.2005.10.003

Abstract: The Laboratory Response Network (LRN) was established in 1999 in response to the worldwide concern for the potential use of biological or chemical agents in the commission of acts of terrorism. One such example was the numerous "hoax" letters allegedly containing the agent of anthrax that were mailed to a variety of agencies, including family planning clinics. As a result of this realistic threat, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in partnership with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Association of Public Health Laboratories, created the LRN for the purpose of strengthening the nation's capacity to provide immediate and sustained laboratory testing and communication in the event of public health emergencies, particularly in response to acts of bioterrorism. From the time of its establishment to the present, the LRN has been successful in integrating the public and private health laboratory communities, in addition to expanding its original focus of medical laboratories to military laboratories, veterinary laboratories, agricultural laboratories, food and water testing laboratories, and international laboratories. The original designation of laboratories as Levels A, B, C, and D was revised to Sentinel, Reference, and Federal laboratories. They now function as an integrated network, with the major goal being to ensure that the nation's public health and private sector laboratories, along with other select laboratories, are prepared and equipped to respond to a biological or chemical act of terrorism in an appropriate and integrated manner. The lessons learned during the anthrax investigation in 2001 clearly demonstrated the need for an integrated network of laboratories, education, and training of technical personnel and the development of rapid detection and confirmatory technology. The American Society for Microbiology is one of many partners in the LRN and is responsible for maintaining and developing sentinel level testing protocols to either "rule out" or refer possible agents of bioterrorism. The mission of the LRN has been expanded to include not only biological and chemical terrorism, but also emerging infectious diseases and other public health threats and emergencies.

Abstract: The revised International Health Regulations [IHR(2005)], which requires the Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO) to develop core capacities to detect, assess, report, and respond to public health threats, is bringing new challenges for national and international surveillance systems. As more countries move toward implementation and/or strengthening of their infectious disease surveillance programs, the strengthening of clinical microbiology laboratories becomes increasingly important because they serve as the first line responders to detect new and emerging microbial threats, re-emerging infectious diseases, the spread of antibiotic resistance, and the possibility of bioterrorism. In fact, IHR(2005) Core Capacity #8, "Laboratory", requires that laboratory services be a part of every phase of alert and response.Public health laboratories in many resource-constrained countries require financial and technical assistance to build their capacity. In recognition of this, in 2006, the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) established an International Laboratory Capacity Building Program, LabCap, housed under the ASM International Board. ASM LabCap utilizes ASM's vast resources and its membership's expertise-40,000 microbiologists worldwide-to strengthen clinical and public health laboratory systems in low and low-middle income countries. ASM LabCap's program activities align with HR(2005) by building the capability of resource-constrained countries to develop quality-assured, laboratory-based information which is critical to disease surveillance and the rapid detection of disease outbreaks, whether they stem from natural, deliberate or accidental causes.ASM LabCap helps build laboratory capacity under a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and under a sub-contract with the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Successful activities of ASM LabCap have occurred throughout Africa, Asia, Central America and the Caribbean. In addition, ASM LabCap coordinates efforts with international agencies such as the WHO in order to maximize resources and ensure a unified response, with the intended goal to help build integrated disease surveillance and response capabilities worldwide in compliance with HR(2005)'s requirements.

Abstract: The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic is the first pandemic to hit the world in the 21st century. According to World Health Organization (WHO) reports, as of 18 July 2010, more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, and over 18,336 people have died as a result of the disease [1]. In an effort to facilitate the exchange of strategic and operational experience in the fight against the pandemic, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), supported by the China Ministry of Health, in collaboration with WHO, the World Bank, the U.S. CDC, and co-organised with the Elsevier Publishing Group, hosted the International Forum on Pandemic Influenza 2010 in July. The two-day meeting, attended by over 600 international delegates, saw human health and animal health professionals discuss the current situation of the pandemic, the global response and vaccination strategies, pandemic surveillance and preparedness, and the animal-human interface in influenza and other emerging infectious diseases. A summary of the discussions is presented here. Copyright 2010. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.

ISSN: 0889-048X

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007478809782

Abstract: The relation and collaboration of human and animal medicine had its ups and downs throughout history. The interaction between these two disciplines has been especially fruitful in the broad areas of pathophysiology and of epidemiology. An exploration of the interaction between the two disciplines, using historical and contemporary examples in comparative medicine, zoonoses, zooprophylaxis, and human-animal bond, reveals that a better understanding of animal and human disease, as well as societal changes such as interest in non-conventional medicine, are leading to a broader concept of one medicine that includes animal and human medicine as well as social and other sciences.

Short Title: Barriers to public health management of a pertussis outbreak in Arkansas

ISSN: 1072-4710

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archpedi.158.2.146

Abstract: Background: During the 2001-2002 respiratory season, Arkansas, USA experienced one of its worst pertussis outbreaks. This crisis occurred shortly after the 11 September 2001, terrorist attacks. Objective: To determine whether vulnerabilities in the public health infrastructure existed in the context of emerging infectious diseases or possible bioterrorist attacks. Design: Key personnel involved in the Arkansas pertussis outbreak were interviewed, and health department epidemiological data were reviewed. Setting: Observations were made for the statewide private-public management of the epidemic. Participants: Physicians, infectious disease specialists, epidemiologists, field nurses, health department staff, laboratory staff, and administrators. Main Outcome Measures: Diagnosis capability; vaccine, prophylaxis, and treatment programs; and effectiveness of global outbreak management. Results: Diagnosis of pertussis was a major barrier to management of the outbreak. The nonspecific clinical diagnosis, unreliability of testing methods, excessive number of samples, unavailability of reagents, and inadequate transport system, laboratory personnel, and equipment all impeded effective diagnosis. Vaccine shortage was not believed to contribute to the extent of the outbreak. Prophylaxis was problematic because of feared adverse effects of drugs and uncertainty about the efficacy of new drugs, but compliance was found to be good. From a public health perspective, isolation procedures, school absence policies, and health department referrals to private physicians all contributed to confusion. Problems with communications, staffing, and public cooperation were identified. Despite these barriers, the epidemic was well tolerated, with no known mortality and limited morbidity. Conclusions: Despite many identified barriers to effective public health management, Arkansas tolerated its worst epidemic of pertussis in many years. However, were the state to experience an outbreak of a more pathogenic agent, introduced either naturally or of bioterrorist origin, these vulnerabilities could become critical. Natural outbreaks serve as excellent experiences on which to recognize and correct barriers to public health management.

Abstract: Prevention and control of food-borne zoonoses is given high priority in Germany and in the European Union. To implement targeted control measures, detailed data are necessary on human zoonoses and on the prevalence of zoonotic agents along the food chain. EU-wide legislations have been stipulated that allow collection and collation of relevant data across member states. The necessary structures have been established and are being constantly refined. In addition, surveillance systems and early warning systems have been improved or set up, respectively, to timely investigate and control food-borne outbreaks and to transnationally communicate food safety risks. For prevention and control to be effective, well-defined responsibilities and close collaboration of public health, veterinary public health and food safety authorities are needed. This report reviews the pertinent legislation, the established structures, and the collaboration of competent authorities in Germany and particularly in Europe. In the future, data quality and collaboration on national and EU levels will likely be further improved. Targeted control measures, particularly at primary production, are expected to lead to a sustainable reduction of the incidence of food-borne zoonoses.

Abstract: The 'Livestock Revolution' and globalization with enormous increases in free trade of animals and food products are not a choice but a reality ( Thiermann, J. Vet. Med. Educ., 28, 2001, 56 ). Conditions of modern life, some of them related to or being the result of globalization, ensure that factors responsible for disease emergence are more prevalent than ever. Categorization of the factors is somewhat arbitrary but are representative of the underlying processes that cause emergence. Major responsible factors include ecological changes, such as changes due to agriculture or economic development or to anomalies in climates, human demographical changes and behaviour, travel and commerce, technology and industry, microbial adaptation and change, and the breakdown of public health measures ( Morse, Emerg. Infect. Dis., 1, 1995, 7 ). Furtheron, concerning pathogens, their most striking feature emerging and re-emerging is their diversity, ranging from viruses and prions, over bacteria and rickettsia, fungi, protozoa to helminths. As presently the epidemiological perspective does not permit reliable prediction and prevention of most damaging new pathogens, and as the evolutionary perspective only provides rough theoretical estimates for selective processes in pathogen populations, surveillance and monitoring remain the most important methods to recognize early that 'something has happened'. In light of the complexity and diversity of likely new emerging diseases, such surveillance may be more broadly targeted and aimed more realistically at early recognition of disease syndromes rather than at identifying microbial diseases. The complex and rapid-paced development of international trade, coupled with increasing societal demands for not only abundant and inexpensive food as well as for protection from diseases originating from animals, demands immediate attention from the veterinary community. The inter-relationship at the minimum between animal production, animal diseases and human diseases demands that we consider our concepts, methods and structures. There exists a huge growth area for the veterinary profession; substantial need exists for trained individuals who understand the science of foreign diseases, who can facilitate emergency management operations against diseases ( Brown, J. Vet. Med. Educ., 30, 2003, 112 ) and who can contribute to adjust and strategically develop animal production systems further.
