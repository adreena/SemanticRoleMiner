It's the food recall that just won't end. From the recall of a single batch of its “Diamond Naturals” dry dog food on 6 Apr 2012 for possible salmonella contamination, Diamond Pet Foods has expanded the recall on 8 separate occasions, endured a week-long inspection of one of its plants by the FDA, which criticized its practices, and most recently acknowledged that cats are also at risk.
Yet the Missouri based maker of Diamond, Premium Edge, Kirkland Signature, and other pet food brands has not called special attention to the expansion of the recall to cat food beyond amending a statement on the company’s Internet recall site: Diamond Pet Foods has voluntarily recalled some brands of dry dog and cat food that it manufactured in its Gaston, SC facility between 9 Dec 2011 and 7 Apr 2012 due to potential Salmonella contamination.
On Friday morning, 18 May 2012, the Calgary Herald in Alberta, Canada, reported that 2 cats in a Montreal animal shelter have died, and another is ill, after eating Diamond Pet Foods products. 
Also in Quebec,another person has been reported with a case of salmonellosis, bringing the total number of cases to 16 in the USA and Canada caused apparently by handling the pet food. Also on the same day, the company issued yet another recall involving certain sizes of its Diamond Naturals lamb and rice dog food manufactured on 26 Aug 2011, which is later than the date range for all its other recalled products so far.
One of the unusual aspects of this recall is Diamond's release of information. On 12 Apr 2012, 6 days after Diamond's first recall, the FDA began an investigation.
Its week-long inspection of Diamond's Gaston facility found numerous violations.
All reasonable precautions are not taken to ensure that production procedures to not contribute contamination from any source, its report said, noting that the factory’s screening process for possible contaminants wasn’t thorough enough.
